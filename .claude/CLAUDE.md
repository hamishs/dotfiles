## Code Quality Requirements
* Good formatting, no trailing spaces.
* Only necessary comments. I.e. those that explain non-obvious code or decisions. Don't explain the obvious flow of the code.

## Documentation Requirements
* Only write doc files (like README.md, DOCKER.md, etc) when explicitly asked.
* Extreme brevity in documentation and READMEs. Only the most essential information or examples.

## Development Requirements
* Use linters and formatters after making changes (pre-commit for Python, ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript, fmt and clippy for Rust). Use the repo to find the setup for these.
